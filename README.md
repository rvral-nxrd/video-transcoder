# 🎬 Transcode Service

 I designed this script specifically for `Davinci Resolve` free users on Linux, since it does not support a lot of codecs. I used codecs I know work without issue, stay close to the original file's quality and file size. 
 It watches a specified directory for new video files, transcodes them using `ffmpeg`, and organizes the output by creation date.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Transcoding**  
  Monitors a directory using `inotifywait` and triggers transcoding on file write completion.

- **Date-Based Organization**  
  Output files are stored in subfolders named after the original file's creation date.

- **Custom Logging**  
  Each transcoding session generates a timestamped log file. Users can optionally specify a custom log directory.

- **Systemd Integration**  
  Runs as a persistent background service using `systemd`.

- **Uninstall Support**  
  Clean removal of all service components via a single `--uninstall` flag.

- **Cross-Distro Compatibility**  
  Supports `apt`, `dnf`, and `pacman` package managers.

  ⚠️ *Alpine support has been deprecated and will be handled in a separate script.*

## 🎞 Transcoding Logic

The `transcode.sh` script handles the actual conversion:

- **Input**: Any video file detected in the watched directory  
- **Output**: `.mov` format using the `mpeg-4` video codec and `pcm_s16le` audio codec 
- **Post-process**: Deletes original file after successful transcoding  
- **Logging**: Outputs to `/var/log/transcode/[timestamp].log` or custom path via `-L`

---

## 📁 Logging Example

```bash
./transcode.sh -L /home/siyamthanda/logs /videos/input.mp4
```

Creates a log file like:

```
/home/siyamthanda/logs/20250829_173100.log
```

---

## 🔧 Uninstallation

To remove the service and clean up all files:

```bash
./install.sh --uninstall
```

This will:
- Stop and disable the systemd service
- Remove service files and scripts
- Delete log and script directories

## 🧊 Alpine Linux Support

Alpine support has been **removed** from the current version.  
A dedicated Alpine-compatible script will be released separately.
